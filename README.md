# ASE-Alert

This project is a web application that provides notifications for Automated Speed Enforcement (ASE) locations in Toronto. The application uses Leaflet.js to display a map with ASE locations and provides real-time notifications when the user is near an active speed camera.

## How It Works

The application fetches ASE location data from the City of Toronto's Open Data portal and displays the locations on a map. If a vehicle is detected by the ASE system travelling in excess of the posted speed limit, the registered owner of the vehicle will receive a violation notice regardless of who was driving. The total payable amount is determined by Ontario Regulation 355/22 under the Highway Traffic Act and includes a Set Fine, victim fund component, and a provincial licence plate access fee. No demerit points will be issued by the Ministry of Transportation and no oneâ€™s driving record will be impacted.

As of December 2022, Toronto's Automated Speed Enforcement (ASE) program had collected $34 million in fines from speed cameras.
